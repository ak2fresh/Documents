Bickel and Doksum Chapters 1-6.
Topics include: 
exponential family models, 
distribution theory for statistics,
the sufficiency principle, 
least squares estimation, 
the method of moments,
maximum likelihood estimation, 
Bayes and minimax procedures, 
uniform minimum variance unbiased estimation, 
hypothesis testing, the Neyman-Pearson lemma, likelihood ratio procedures, 
limit theory for MLEs & M-estimates,
the general linear model, the Gauss-Markov theorem, 
simultaneous inference, 
decision theory, 
chi-square methods,
goodness-of-fit tests, 
and nonparametric and robust methods.

Prerequisites:
 * Probability at the 553.620 level (Ross's book)
 * Statistics at the 553.630 level (Rice's book)

In spring 2020 I will teach a follow-on course to 553.730:
EN.553.739: Statistical Pattern Recognition Theory & Methods
"Statistical pattern recognition" is my version of an explicitly prob/stat-centric
"machine learning" course, following naturally from 553.730.
