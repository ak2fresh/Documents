cep Office Hours = TBD

Chapter 1 of B&D is a whirlwind tour of ideas we will use
throughout our continuing study of mathematical statistics.
Skim this chapter, and the problems.
(Just *skim* -- read quickly, without necessarily working through all the details!
Keep track of passages which you don't fully understand,
but don't allow these passages to deter you from finishing the reading.
Familiarity with the ideas is important.
We will highlight important details in class or with homework,
and many of the details we will return to when needed ...)

Reading chapter 1 can be daunting; I recommend that you consider getting a head start!

NB: Homework #1 will be assigned in class tuesday september 03
    and is due at the beginning of class thursday september 05.

cheers,
carey
